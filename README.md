# TYPO3 Extension `infinitescrolling`

## What does it do?

This TYPO3 Extension can replace various PageBrowsers, hide them and realizes infinite scrolling.
If you scroll down a list, the list of the next page will be automatically appended to
the current list. You, as a website visitor don't need to click on to the next page anymore.
Further the old PageBrowser still exists in Source code, so screen readers should work just fine.

## Installation

### Installation using Composer

Run the following command within your Composer based TYPO3 project:

```
composer require jweiland/infinitescrolling
```

### Installation using Extension Manager

Login into TYPO3 Backend of your project and click on `Extensions` in the left menu.
Press the `Retrieve/Update` button and search for the extension key `infinitescrolling`.
Import the extension from TER (TYPO3 Extension Repository)
